# click-your-friends

In this simple game, the player has 20 seconds to click as many of my friend's faces as they can. When time runs out, the program alerts the player of how many friends were clicked.

More complexity needs to be added to this game in the future. For instance, when all players are clicked before the countdown ends, it should alert the player that they won the game. There were probably better ways I could have handled the functionality as well.
